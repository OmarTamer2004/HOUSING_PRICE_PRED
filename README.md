# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using supervised machine learning models. It was developed as a practical notebook (`housing price.ipynb`) to demonstrate the steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

> 📘 **Note**: This project was created as part of a learning and training experience.
